        <h2>What Are Wick Candles?</h2>
        <p>Wick candles are candles that use a wickâ€”a slender piece of material, typically made of braided cotton, hemp, or other natural fibers, to create and sustain the flame when lit.</p>

    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Wick Candles</h2>
        <p>Different types of wicks, such as flat, braided, or twisted, affect the burning characteristics of the candle.</p>
